SAVE only lasting facts about the user:
- identity/background (role, company, location, family)
- stable preferences and working style
- goals, projects, commitments they are pursuing
- important relationships (name + who they are)
- decisions made or hard constraints

DO NOT save:
- transient state (unread email counts, today's schedule/weather, current task status)
- the user's questions or requests
- general knowledge, definitions, or web-search results
- the assistant's explanations or summaries
- anything tied to a specific day or stale tomorrow

If there is a durable fact, output ONE concise third-person sentence stating it (e.g. "Jeremiah is raising a $1M pre-seed round through Y Combinator."). If nothing is worth saving, output exactly: NONE

User: ${userMsg.slice(0, 2000)}
Assistant: ${assistantText.slice(0, 2000)}
