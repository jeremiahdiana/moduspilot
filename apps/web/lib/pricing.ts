 * pinned to gemini-3.5-flash-LITE at $0.52 per 1M (lib/chat/model-cost.ts), and
 * costWeight rounds UP, so $0.52/1M is a ceiling on what a unit can actually cost
 * us. The add-on raises the WEEKLY cap by 3.5M units (window*7), and the week is
 * what bounds the month: 3.5M x (30/7) = 15M units/month x $0.52/1M = $7.80/month
 * worst case — every unit burned on frontier models — against $10 of revenue. 22%
 * margin at the floor, and far above that in practice.
 *
 * Cost and price both scale linearly with quantity, so the margin is identical
 * whether someone buys one or five.
 *
 * ⚠️ The margin is eaten by ESTIMATION ERROR, not usage — and that has already
 * bitten once: gemini-3.5-flash was carrying flash-LITE's rates, 4.3x understated,
 * while it was the baseline. The unit's dollar value survived that (flash-lite
 * took over the baseline with the same $0.52), so this margin is intact, but the
 * lesson stands: an `est: true` price is an undone to-do, not a hedge.
 * Re-verify the baseline's rate before increasing windowUnits.
