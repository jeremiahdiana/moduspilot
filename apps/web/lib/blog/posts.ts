/**
 * The posts.
 *
 * 🚨 EVERY PRICE AND MODEL LIST HERE WAS VERIFIED 2026-07-27 AGAINST PUBLISHED
 * SOURCES, NOT RECALLED. Comparison content is the fastest-rotting thing on a
 * marketing site: a wrong competitor price is checkable in one click and costs
 * the reader for good. `updated` is rendered on the page so a stale post is
 * visibly stale. Re-verify before changing any figure below.
 *
 * MODUS's OWN model lists were re-synced to lib/models.ts on 2026-10-25 (the
 * generation swap). `updated` was deliberately NOT bumped: it dates the
 * COMPETITOR facts, and those were not re-checked that day.
 *
 * MODUS ranks first. The one-line disclosure stays: it is what lets a page rank
 * itself #1 without reading as an ad, which is the whole reason the format works.
 * Competitor strengths are described where they are real, because a comparison
 * that describes rivals as worthless at everything is the standard spam pattern
 * and gets buried rather than ranked. What is NOT here, deliberately, is any
 * volunteering of MODUS weaknesses that no reader asked about.
 *
 * ⛔ DO NOT ADD unverifiable performance claims — "never hallucinates", "most
 * accurate", "beats X on benchmarks". There is no MODUS accuracy benchmark to
 * cite. Those are checkable, they are false-advertising shaped, and one of them
 * discredits every real number on the page. The defensible version of that
 * argument is the cross-checking section: running several models is how a wrong
 * answer gets caught, because one model cannot tell you it is wrong. That claim
 * is true, it is ours alone, and it needs no benchmark.
