            AS STATIC WEIGHTS — because Satoshi ships NO 600 and Sentient ships
            no 600 either. Tailwind's `font-semibold` IS 600, so every semibold
            in the product was being rendered by the Bold 700 file: measured on
            prod, Satoshi 600 and 700 had an identical advance width
            (717.77px), which is why bold text read as too heavy everywhere,
            the dashboard included.
            The variable faces cover 300–900 (Satoshi) and 200–700 (Sentient),
            so 600 is now a real interpolated weight sitting between Medium and
            Bold. It is also FEWER requests — one file per family per style
            instead of five. Verify with advance width, never
            document.fonts.check(): check() answers "can this family render
            this text" and returns true for weights whose file does not exist. */}
