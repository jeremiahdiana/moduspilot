// The one-line verdict under a comparison. Runs on gpt-4o-mini once all three
// columns finish. Judgement is about which answer served the user better, not
// which model is "best" in the abstract.

// This must hold a WHOLE answer, whatever the compare route is currently willing
// to generate. It was 1500, which silently cut a normal 5-paragraph essay in half
// — and the judge then reported the answer as "cut off, leaving it incomplete"
// and marked the model DOWN for damage we had done to it. A judge must see what
// the user saw, or it is reviewing our truncation, not the model.
//
// 🪤 That is a coupling, and it drifted: 4000 was correct when compare capped
// answers at 900 output tokens, but reasoning models there now get 16000 (~64k
// chars). So the identical bug came back on exactly the long-form answers the
// clarify gate invites the user to ask for. Sized to the cap, not to a guess.
// Worst case is 3 x 64k chars ≈ 48k tokens into gpt-4o-mini's 128k context.
