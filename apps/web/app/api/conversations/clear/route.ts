/**
 * Permanently delete every conversation for the signed-in user — the "Delete
 * all chats" action in Settings → Account → Danger Zone.
 *
 * This is a HARD delete, unlike the per-row sidebar delete which only sets
 * `deleted: true` (recoverable from Trash). Wiping the whole `conversations`
 * collection also clears anything sitting in Trash, which is the intent.
 *
 * Uses the native Firestore `recursiveDelete` on the collection (reached via
 * `col.firestore`, since the `adminDb` wrapper's own recursiveDelete only takes
 * a document path). recursiveDelete removes each conversation doc AND any legacy
 * `messages` subcollection some old docs still carry — modern chats store
 * messages as an inline array, so a plain doc delete would usually suffice, but
 * this is safe for both shapes.
 *
 * No desktop reconciliation is needed: desktop sync never writes conversations.
 * Mobile subscribes to the same collection in real time, so its list clears
 * automatically.
