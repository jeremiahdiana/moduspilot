/**
 * Hard daily cap on unattended watch looks.
 *
 * ⚠️ DERIVED FROM THE PLAN CEILING, not from taste. The previous number (12/hour)
 * was chosen by reasoning about how often an assistant should interrupt someone,
 * and never once costed against the budget it spends from. Measured on a real
 * account: a watch look on Claude Sonnet 5 with the full life-OS context is
 * ~126,000 budget units, and the MODUS daily ceiling is 500,000 — so FOUR looks
 * consumed an entire day, and a 12/hour cap emptied it in twenty minutes.
 *
 * Watch now runs on a fixed cheap vision model (1x weight instead of 9x) with
 * smaller frames, which puts a look near ~1,300 units. 30 looks is then ~7.8% of a
 * MODUS day — a background feature's fair share, rather than all of it.
 *
 * 🪤💸 THESE NUMBERS ARE ONLY TRUE WHILE WATCH_MODEL IS WEIGHT 1. They were briefly
 * false: watch was pinned to `gemini-3.5-flash`, which the flash/flash-lite reprice
 * moved from weight 1 to weight 5, and a look really cost 6,540 units (39.2% of a
 * day) while this comment still claimed ~1,500 and ~9%. A cost written in a comment
 * is not a guard. `scripts/verify-watch-budget.ts` in apps/web is the guard —
 * re-run it whenever WATCH_MODEL, this cap, the frame size or any price changes.
