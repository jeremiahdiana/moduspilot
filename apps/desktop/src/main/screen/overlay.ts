 *      screen. That is a feedback loop, and it looks exactly like the model
 *      hallucinating context that "was on screen".
 *
 * Hiding is used rather than toggling setContentProtection (which also excludes
 * the window from capture) because hiding is deterministic. Content protection
 * takes effect on a compositor frame boundary, so a capture fired immediately
 * after enabling it is a race — and a race here silently reintroduces the bug on

 *      notification, and the model answered about the wrong thing.
 *   2. Put the panel into its busy state, so the Ask button flipped to "Stop"
 *      while the user was mid-sentence typing their own question.
 *   3. Overwrote currentCapture / pendingImage — so if you had just drag-selected
 *      an area to ask about, a watch tick 20 seconds later silently replaced it
 *      with a full screenshot, and your question was answered about that instead.
 *   4. Read its own "previous frame" back out of currentCapture, which meant a
 *      user region-crop in between made the next comparison "full screen vs a
 *      crop of something else" — a comparison of two unrelated pictures.
 *
 * It also must not stream into the panel: the whole point is that MODUS speaks up
