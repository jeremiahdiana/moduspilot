// Fails the release BEFORE an 8-minute build if the credentials it needs are
// missing from the environment.
//
// This exists because of a real, silent failure (2026-07-22): `npm run release`
// ran to completion with none of these set. electron-builder does not treat a
// missing credential as an error — MacTargetHelper.notarizeIfProvided() calls
// log.warn("skipped macOS notarization") and returns. The result looked like a
// successful release but was a signed-but-UNNOTARIZED build that was never
// published: no latest-mac.yml, no GitHub release, and artifacts macOS
// Gatekeeper blocks on any machine other than the one that built them
// ("Apple cannot check it for malicious software"). Shipping that is worse than
// shipping nothing, and nothing in the output says so.
//
// The three notarization paths below mirror MacTargetHelper.getNotarizeOptions
// exactly, in its order — keep them in sync if electron-builder changes.

// The nicest path: store the app-specific password in the keychain ONCE, then
// only ever export APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE. App-specific passwords do not
// expire, and Apple never shows one twice, so this is also how you stop losing it:
//   xcrun notarytool store-credentials modus-notary \
//     --apple-id app@joinfitr.com --team-id 8KF5J7X9BU --password '<pw>'
